## About Me

I’m a third-year B.Tech (Hons.) student in Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) at MIT Bengaluru.

My interests lie in building AI-powered systems that solve real-world problems. I’ve worked on projects involving deep learning, computer vision, and web-based interfaces for use cases such as plant disease classification, wound monitoring, and thermal object detection.

I enjoy connecting practical needs with scalable machine learning models, and I’m continuously learning how to design, train, and deploy them effectively.
